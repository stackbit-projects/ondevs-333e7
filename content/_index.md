          A sole trader, based in a metropolitan American city. A population
          consisting of wealthy elite. Those either unable, or unwilling to
          service their own homes. Big homes. Converting each day that we resume
          the campaigns for as little as $3 per lead in an industry where the
          average click is $15. The revenue from one sale exceeded $500 with 80%
          profit. This enabled the sole trader to set up practice in America,
          open a small store, buy more equipment, purchase two branded vehicles
          and hire three new employees.

          We ran a promotion before the winter holidays, offering a free teeth
          whitening to the established target demographic, increasing patient
          signups with the use of the treatment. Any subsequent visits and
          treatments were additional business revenue. In a short month we
          produced 15 new patients. A monumental achievement, and with average
          dental patient lifetime billings being around £46,000. A potential
          £690,000 lifetime value was created in just a month.
